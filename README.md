# Bridge

Dealing with overcomplicated marketing platforms can be a nightmare, especially when all you want is a simple and effective way to showcase your job openings. With Bridge, you can wave goodbye to those complex tools and say hello to streamlined job page creation.

## Current State
As you might have seen, at the moment Bridge can be only accessed through an invite. I want people to test the tool, gather feedback, and iterate based on that. I plan to release it without any (major) bugs or details missing.

## Open-Source
I have open-sourced the project to give other people the opportunity to contribute to the project or enabling them to having a starting point for their own plans.
